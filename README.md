# Multi-Aspect Explainable Inductive Relation Prediction by Sentence Transformer

This repository contains code and data for AAAI submission **Multi-Aspect Explainable Inductive Relation Prediction by Sentence Transformer**.
In the paper, we propose a novel approach for inductive relation prediction namely KRST. KRST adopts sentence transformer for path-based prediction and could provide a comprehensive explanation.
